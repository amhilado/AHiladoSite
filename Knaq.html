            Knaq is an app that provides Content Creators with more ownership of their content and instantly
            provides larger payouts compared to platforms such as Twitch or Youtube, where they take a large percentage
            of what the Creator earns. This is done through the efficiency of BSV Bitcoin since it has low
            transaction/gas fees.
            <br><br>
            For this project, I was the main UX/UI designer working directly with the CEO of Knaq. The main features
            that we wanted to focus on building out were the tipping/subscriptions, and the in-app wallet. The users
            would be able to earn feathers, which is the in-app currency, and convert the feathers into cryptocurrency
            so they can instantly deposit the money they made into their crypto wallet.
        </p>

        <h1 class="text-center">Defining the Problem</h1>

        <p id="projectText">
            Content creators put a lot of time and effort into creating, but most platforms take a large percentage of
            the profit (Ex: Twitch takes 50% of profits gained from bits and subscriptions, Facebook and Instagram take
            55% of ad revenue), and require certain prerequisites for creators to start earning money on their platform.
            This revenue system can drive away and discourage smaller content creators from even creating in the first place.
            <br><br>
            Challenges:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Startup was still in early stages of development
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lack of real user data due to time and budgetary constraints
                </li>
                <li>
                    Existing UI needed an overhaul
                 </li>
            </ul>

        </p>

        <h1 class="text-center">Who are we designing for?</h1>
        <!-- <img class="projectImg" src="images/NSA/Color Palette.jpg"> -->

        <p id="projectText">
            Although we didn't have any real users to help us conduct research, we were able to identify and define the
            potential users we were building the app for.
        </p>

        <!-- Content Creators <img src="images/camera-retro-solid.svg"> add icon of a "Content Creator" -->
        <!-- Supporters <img src="images" add icon of a "Supporter" -->
        <!-- Casual Content Consumers <img src="images" add icon of a "Consumer" -->

        <h1 class="text-center">Competitive Analysis</h1>
        <!-- <a href="/images/Knaq/KnaqComparativeAnalysisS.jpg" data-lightbox="mygallery"><img src="images/Knaq/KnaqComparativeAnalysisS.jpg"></a> -->
        <img class="projectImg" src="images/Knaq/KnaqComparativeAnalysisM.jpg">

        <p id="projectText">
            Looking at other content creations platforms that pay creators, most of them require creators to meet a
            specific set of requirements (certain number of followers/subscribers, average view counts/likes, etc.)
            before they can start earning money. Once the creator does start earning money, they receive their payment
            at specific periods, whether it be monthly, or reaching a certain revenue threshold. None of the platforms
            allow creators to instantly deposit their revenue into their account.
        </p>

        <h1 class="text-center">Feature Prioritization</h1>

        <p id="projectText">
            Features were prioritized based on value provided to the user. In the case with Knaq, giving users the 
            ability to deposit any money earned directly into their crypto wallet without deducting any transaction 
            fees was one of the main features we wanted to focus on.
        </p>

        <h1 class="text-center">Solution</h1>

        <p id="projectText">
            In order to provide creators with more control over their content and the full revenue they have earned 
            through tips and subscriptions, we decided to integrate an in-app wallet. The in-app wallet will allow 
            creators to deposit their revenue earned into their crypto wallet without having to worry about any 
            transaction fees thanks to the low gas fees of BSV Bitcoin.
        </p>

        <h1 class="text-center">Visual Design</h1>

        <p id="projectText">
            The in-app wallet was designed to be streamlined and straightforward to make it easier for the user to 
            deposit, withdraw, and send their currency. We narrowed down the number of steps it takes to move currency 
            between the in-app wallet and the userâ€™s crypto wallet in order to make the process more smooth.
        </p>

        <p id="projectText">
            As for the tipping/subscription features, we wanted to make it easy and straight-forward to use while 
            maintaining an aesthetically pleasing experience. We simplified the color palette and made the call to 
            action buttons the secondary color to provide contrast against the white background.
        </p>

        <h1 class="text-center">Future Considerations</h1>
            
        <p id="projectText">
            Going forward with this project, I would like to conduct more through research with our user base to gain 
            a better understanding of what current features of the app work well, and what features can be improved. 
            This will be done through more prototyping, user testing, user interviews, and empathy mapping.
        </p>
