            This project was a group project with my peers Brett Wilson and Anahita Bagherpour. For this project we were
            focusing on a business in the service industry, in this case, Barnes and Noble. My roles for this project
            included conducting UX research such as interviews, defining our problem statement and insight, and
            developing a user journey, and also UI design by creating a high-fidelity prototype of our mobile
            application based off of our paper sketches and prototypes.
            <br><br>
            Over the course of 2 weeks we worked through the design process of defining who our user is, defining the
            problem based off our user research, generating ideas based off of our insight, prototyping through
            sketching and wireframing, testing our prototype, and then iterating on our prototype.
        </p>

        <h1 class="text-center">Defining Our User</h1>

        <p id="projectText">
            To help us start our research, we decided to define who our potential user might be. We formulated a
            proto-persona who represented a typical customer at Barnes and Noble, someone who regularly read books and
            spent a lot of time at Barnes and Noble.
            <br><br>
            We then decided to conduct deeper research and go to a local Barnes and Noble and interview a user in order
            to get more insight of what we can potentially do to help improve a user's experience at Barnes and Noble.
            We were fortunate enough to sit down and talk to Tatianna Nicolla, who currently studies at UCSD for Law,
            and ask her about her overall experience with Barnes and Noble. From her interview we were able to acquire
            valuable information that would help us improve the experience users have with Barnes and Noble. We learned
            that she enjoys finding new books to read, enjoys sharing books with her friends, but also needs an easier
            way to do both since she is pretty limited on time due to her tight schedule. With the knowledge gained from
            the interview, we found that there seems to be a small struggle the user faces when trying to find new books
            whether it be through individual exploration or through recommendations from others.
        </p>

        <h1 class="text-center">What's the Problem?</h1>

        <p id="projectText">
            We noticed that there were a few complications with the book finding/searching process at Barnes and Noble,
            so we wanted to help enhance that experience. This lead us to address the problem of how might we improve
            Barnes and Noble and see a larger book community, increased customer traffic, and increased sales?
            <br><br>
            In order to address the problem we're trying to solve, we started to write down potential ideas on post-its
            and sort the ideas out based on what we believed to be the most plausible solution through the use of an
            affinity diagram. Through the affinity diagram we found that Barnes and Noble is struggling to provide a
            quick and modern way of book sharing therefore coming up short in helping build a larger community around
            books which could greatly increase their customer traffic and sales.
        </p>

        <img src="images/Bookmmunity/Postit.png" style="width: 100%; height: 100%; padding: 3% 0%;">

        <h1 class="text-center">We Have An Idea!</h1>

        <p id="projectText">
            We came up with the idea of creating a sort of social app that ties in with books, essentially building a
            stronger community around books through more modern, digital means. The app will provide a list of book
            suggestions that is specifically catered to the user based off of the previous books they've read, genres
            they're interested in, etc. We also came up with the idea of allowing the user to add friends on the app,
            and giving the user the ability to share books with their friends, thus presenting the other users with more
            suggestions on what books to read.
            <br><br>
            Once the user decides on what book they want, our app helps the user locate where the book is specifically
            in the Barnes and Noble location of the user's choice, in return greatly reducing the time it typically
            takes a user to find a book by themselves, which will make locating a specific book a much more streamlined
            and enjoyable process. If the user enjoys the book, we also give them the option to share the book with
            their friends, via their social media accounts.
            <br><br>
            We decided to map out the potential experience a user would go through while using the app to help us gauge
            a user's emotions and help us determine which parts of the experience we can improve on and how to
            potentially improve it.
        </p>

        <h1 class="text-center">Will it Work?</h1>

        <p id="projectText">
            Once we finalized the idea that addressed a problem that we faced, creating a solution via a prototype was
            the next step in the process. We went through various iterations of home screens, login flows and so on, so
            we decided to combine all of our different ideas into one final paper prototype in InVision and see how well
            it would work.

            We let our friends and fellow peers test this paper prototype in order to give us a general idea of how the
            current version of our app would fair in a real world situation. We tasked users to get from point A to
            point B within the app and observed the steps that they took in order to get to that end goal. Once they
            finished their task, we asked them how the overall experience was while using the app. We received a lot of
            useful feedback from them on what worked well, what didn't work well, and what features can be improved and
            how to improve those features.
            <br><br>
            Based on the feedback from the user tests, we decided to make adjustments accordingly in order to enhance
            the user experience. A few changes included revising the layout of the login screen, adding labels to the
            bottom navigation buttons, and including a search filter on the list of books screen. With those changes, we
            created our low fidelity prototype:

            We also sent our low fidelity prototype to Tatianna to get her feedback and what she thinks about the app
            so far. She gave us great insight on things that might need some work as certain features weren't very
            clear, such as where the suggestions from friends section was located, or why the Barnes & Noble account was
            connected to the app. Of course fixing these features would be something great to consider in future
            iterations.
        </p>

        <h1 class="text-center">Findings and Future Considerations</h1>

        <p id="projectText">
            What we found after going through the UX process and letting users navigate through our prototype was that
            through various testing and iterations, the major problems that the user encounters will become more
            apparent and will help us create a more viable solution based on the user's feedback therefore creating a
            product that will benefit and be of great use to the user.
            <br><br>
            With the research and feedback gathered from iterating through the UX process in mind, I decided to make
            small revisions to the app, such as adding more color, photos, and text, to develop a more high-fidelity
            prototype as seen below.
